One-to-Many relationship is one of the most important modelling relationship that is used to design
the backend applications.

Eg: I posted one picture in instagram, but i got likes, comments and someother. Called one to Many


There are two data models for this kind of relationship as well:
○ Reference Data Models (Normalisation)
○ Embedded Data Models (Denormalisation)

There are three criteria to decide whether to choose referencing or embedding, with the
objective to improve application performance
○ Types of relationships 
○ Data access pattern
○ Data cohesion

Consider that we are designing a tutorial blog data model. Some of the relationships that we can
think of for a tutorial blog model are:
○ A blog can have some images
○ A blog can have multiple comments
○ Multiple blogs based on single category

• All the above mentioned examples have one-to-many relationship.

● One-to-Many relationships have three categories:

○ One-to-Few //Think these with social media examples like instagram. 
○ One-to-Many
○ One-to-aLot

● Depending on the types of relationships, data access patterns, or data cohesion, one can
decide how to implement the data model, in other words, decide if we should denormalise or
normalise the data.


○ One-to-Few //Always use embedded
○ One-to-Many// either use embedded or relational
○ One-to-aLot //Always use relational
