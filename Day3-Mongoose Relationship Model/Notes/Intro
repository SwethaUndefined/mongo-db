to implement the relationship between various schemas by defining an
association between them.

Primary and Foreign key:

Primary key is used to identify data uniquely therefore two rows can’t have the same primary key.
It can’t be null. On the other hand, foreign key is used to maintain relationship between two tables.

Types of associations :
1. One-to-One
2. One-to-Many
3. Many-to-Manys

Data Models:
1. Reference Data Models (Normalisation)
2. Embedded Data Models (Denormalisation)
