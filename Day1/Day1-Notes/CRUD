Every database management system needs to perform a series of four essential operations.
These operations are collectively referred to as CRUD operations, or Create, Read, Update
and Delete operations. 

They help us store, retrieve, update and remove records from any type of database system.

1. Update the values using db.collection.update()
2. Read the documents using db.collection.find()
3. We can create a new document using the db.collection.insert()
4. Delete a document using db.collection.remove().

Delete:

db.collection("usersData").deleteOne(
        {fName: "Swetha"},
        (err,response)=>{
            if(err){
                console.log("Failed to insert");
            }
            else{
                console.log("Inserted successfully "+JSON.stringify(response));
            }
        }
    )
}
);

Delete the fname starts with "Swetha".

also use deleteMany, for whose mark gte 65, will get delete. Must give second parameter.
