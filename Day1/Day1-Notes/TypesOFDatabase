1. Relational Databases
2. Non-Relational Databases

1. Relational Databases: 
         1.  A relational database means a collection of data items stored in a tabular (table) format.
         2.  These items are organised as sets of tables with rows and columns.

Customer ID       FName        LName                 Address         
C0001             Swetha       Ragunathan            Trichy
C0001             Swetha       Ragunathan            Trichy

The above example is for relational DB, which is in the form of rows and columns.


2. Non-Relational Database:
In a non-relational database, data is stored in an unstructured format. Normally used to store chungs of 
data. Here we can dynamically store data.
There is no relation between the tables in a non-relational database

Advantages:
1. Big data capability
2. Fast performance
