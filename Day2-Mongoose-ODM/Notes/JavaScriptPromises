Mongoose which is a
MongoDB object modelling tool is designed to work in an asynchronous environment and thus,
Mongoose supports both promises and callbacks.


A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved
value, or a reason that it’s not resolved.

A promise may be in one of 3 possible states:
○ fulfilled
○ rejected
○ pending

Every promise will go atleast 2 states. 
First to pending
Next to fulfilled or rejected as per condition.
