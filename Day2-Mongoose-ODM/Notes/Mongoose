We can define schema for maintaining purposes. That is the only reason for mongoose.

Mongoose is an Object Document Modeling (ODM) layer that sits on top of the Node.js
MongoDB API.

Using NoSQL database speeds up the process of application development and reduces the
complexity of deployments.

Why choose Mongoose over MongoDB?
●  Schemas: Schemas allow to give a structure to the collection.
●  Built-in validation: This means you don’t have to write the extra code that you had to write with
the MongoDB driver. 
●  Instance methods: You can define custom methods on a document with minimal code. While
it’s possible to do the same in MongoDB, Mongoose makes it easier to create and organise such
methods within your schema definition.
●  Returning results: Returning documents generated by queries is generally easier in Mongoose.

After doing any CRUD operation, when we saw the output, it shows achknowledge: true, means it will be
updated, deleted or created...We dont want to go everytime check in the compass, whether it is updated
or not.

We  also provide the updated data to the frontend to know them that this is updated or deleted data.

Here mongoose only give the updated data back to the user. Using findAndUpdateOne like we have other methods also.
